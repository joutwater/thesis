#### Research Question:
1.
- Topic: I am visualizing different chemical compound combinations in food that create positive reactions when tasted

- Research Question: Because I want to understand on a chemical or some sort of granular level if there is a way to maximize the experience of food (especially in combination)

- Significance: In order to find a formula behind taste (personal taste?) and show people what is really happening when they are have a bite of an amazing dish. If you do not necessarily enjoy the act of eating, I hope it will offer people more information that will encourage them to enjoy it and think about such an experience.

2.
- Topic: I am visualizing different flavor combinations in food that create positive reactions when tasted (salt, fat, acid, spice, sour)

- Research Question: Because I want to understand how flavor combinations can be maximized to heighten the experience of food.

- Significance: In order to find a formula behind personal taste and show people what is really happening when they are have a bite of an amazing dish. If you do not necessarily enjoy the act of eating, I hope it will offer you more information that will encourage you to enjoy it and think about the miracle of the human body

3.
- Topic: I am visualizing the subjectivity in food taste as it relates to certain dishes throughout NYC's restaurants.

- Research Question: Because I want to find if there are patterns between popular dishes in NYC and why people think those dishes/food combinations are better than others.

- Significance: In order to see if there is an objective way or formula for individuals to choose dishes in NYC, and to make people think more about and appreciate the exprience of food.

### Introduction
1. Background
2. Thesis
### Physiology of Taste - What is happening in your mouth
1. Chemical Level
  - Chemical composition of individual flavors
  - Resultant favorable chemical combinations from mixing such flavors
  - Optimizing combinations to create greatest overall effect across individuals
2. Flavor Level
  - Individual Flavor descriptors (savory, delicate, sour, etc.)
  - Resulting combinations of favorable flavor descriptors
  - Optimizing combinations to create greatest overall effect across individuals
3. Food/Ingredients Level
  - Individual ingredients (raspberry, asparagus, ice cream)
  - Resulting favorable combination of ingredients
  - Optimizing combinations to create greatest overall effect across individuals
4. Outputs
  - Food Science
  - Flavor Pairing
  - Menu Composition
### Psychology of Taste - Environmental factors
1. What you see
  - What does the food look like
  - What does the table look like
  - What does the environment look like
2. What you hear
  - What music is playing
  - How noise level in the environment
  - How is the food described to you
3. What you feel
  - What mood are you in before eating
  - How does food make you feel
  - Does the service affect your mood
### Culture of Taste - Trained for food, or not for food
1. Location
  - Factors of Climate
  - Factors of Geography
  - Factors of Proximity
2. Economy
  - Import/Export Food trends
  - People buying or selling with whom
  - Access to Markets
3. Beliefs
  - Religion's effect on food
  - Personal Choices/ Diets and food

## Berry Quality Analysis
### Who is your audience?

- People interested in learning about detailed processes around our day to day lives that we might not realize

- People who love food (berries) and are interested in how it is "developed"

- People interested in analyzing agriculture variables and outputs

### How is your audience reading or encountering your project? 

- Website: Journalistic entry point regarding background and significance (scrolly)

- Moving to Web App tool which includes data exploration and interacting with layers and details

### What does your project ask of your audience?

- Desire to learn, reading

- Exploration, interaction

- Possible data input

### What does your audience learn and take away from their user experience?

- The audience learns about the intricate science, choices, and processes around optimizing berry flavor and taste. This tells a larger story about modern agriculture and brings up issues like sustainability and GMOs.

### Updated Research Question

- Topic: Visualizing the association of desirable flavor chemicals in berries with particular growing conditions, in test plots (small-scale) and/or in field (large-scale))
- Research Question: Because I want to understand how not only genetic testing but its combination with favorable environmental conditions can lead to berries of highest quality and berries with targeted flavors and flavor combinations.
- Significance: This relationship can help provide crucial data for the industry relating to flavor quality development. For those not in the industry, I believe it is an interesting insight to what goes into a berry and the amazing technologies and modern practices used today in precision agriculture.
