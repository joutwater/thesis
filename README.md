#### Research Question:
1.
- Topic: I am visualizing different chemical compound combinations in food that create positive reactions when tasted

- Research Question: Because I want to understand on a chemical or some sort of granular level if there is a way to maximize the experience of food (especially in combination)

- Significance: In order to find a formula behind taste (personal taste?) and show people what is really happening when they are have a bite of an amazing dish. If you do not necessarily enjoy the act of eating, I hope it will offer people more information that will encourage them to enjoy it and think about such an experience.

2.
- Topic: I am visualizing different flavor combinations in food that create positive reactions when tasted (salt, fat, acid, spice, sour)

- Research Question: Because I want to understand how flavor combinations can be maximized to heighten the experience of food.

- Significance: In order to find a formula behind personal taste and show people what is really happening when they are have a bite of an amazing dish. If you do not necessarily enjoy the act of eating, I hope it will offer you more information that will encourage you to enjoy it and think about the miracle of the human body
